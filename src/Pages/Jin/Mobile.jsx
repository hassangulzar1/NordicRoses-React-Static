            This lovely web is full of everything which is created I don't know
            what in mind, considering that sometimes totally bonkers stuff might
            be highly relevant if it has the right kind of thinking behind it.
            <br />
            <br />
            Luckily, in the middle of all that, there are some pockets of
            content that offer delightfully valuable contrast to cursory wisdom
            in some of the established channels.
